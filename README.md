# SKT-JS: Run `skt` Sanskrit pre-process on your browser!
This repo provides a WASM compiled version with a thin web app for the `skt.c` pre-processing binary in the `sanskrit` LaTeX 2e package: https://ctan.org/tex-archive/language/sanskrit

You can access a convenient, pre-built version of the pre-processor here: https://skt-js.netlify.app

The web app is pretty minimal but is sufficient for most Sanskrit typesetting tasks using the `sanskrit` package. You can take the results and either download it to run LaTeX on the generated document or copy the contents to an online LaTeX environment like Overleaf. 

I am stil working on making aspects like error handling more robust but if you have any requests or feedback, please file an issue!
